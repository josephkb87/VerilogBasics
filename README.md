## Notes;
 * Alot more exists in terms of the work with Verilog(especially for hardware schematics), codes doesnot completely explain it all.
 * Hardware description languages provide a valuable tool
   for computer engineers
 * Any logic circuit (combinational or sequential) can be represented in HDL.
 * Circuits created using keywords and syntax.
 * Possible to use timing information.
 * Explicit delay (#) is for simulation purposes only.
 * Circuits with delays are not synthesizable.
 * Gate and RTL descriptions are possible.
